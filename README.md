All you will find in this repository are the service files for Qtranslate. As it happens, the original developer just disappeared. No one knows where or why. And the program as you understand is quite niche. Since my decompilation skills are about ZERO, and in the services folder of the program JS code, you can think a little (very long), run everything through CHATGPT and everything will work. At the moment I fixed only what I need, if someone comes across this repository and needs it, I will update parsers (as far as possible) for other services.
