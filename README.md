All you will find in this repository are the service files for Qtranslate. As it happens, the original developer just disappeared. No one knows where or why. And the program as you understand is quite niche. Since my decompilation skills are about ZERO, and in the services folder of the program JS code, you can think a little (very long), run everything through CHATGPT and everything will work. At the moment I fixed only what I need, if someone comes across this repository and needs it, I will update parsers (as far as possible) for other services.

How to use it? Download the repository, or just a separate service file, and drop it into the `C:\Program Files (x86)\QTranslate\Services` folder. Then close qtranslate completely and you're good to go.

What did I do? Nothing much, in the case of `Deepl` I made requests to my server running `DeeplX` from [OwO](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX). If you need to, just change the `host` in the service file to your own.

In case of Yandex, I asked [Toil](https://github.com/ilyhalight) for help and he finalized everything to work with Yandex. He has more experience.
